			/* --- LEGACY SECURITY REQUIREMENT ---
			* 
		        * For legacy security reasons, Browsers, Internet Firewalls, and WebRTC
		        * wont let me directly connect to other machines unless they have a
		        * publicly accessible IP address. To get around this WebRTC uses public
		        * "signaling servers" to coordinate where non-IPv6 peers (like a brower)
		        * are and then attempts to establish a P2P connection.
		        *
			*/

			var gun = Gun(['http://localhost:8765/gun', 'https://gun-manhattan.herokuapp.com/gun']);

			/* --- P2P COMMUNICATION ---
			*
		        * GUN uses "relay peers" to automatically perform the function of a "signaling server"
		        * they can also be fully decentralized. Even if a direct connection is not formed
		        * to the ideal peer, DAM (Daisy-chain Ad-hoc Mesh-network) is able to relay
		        * messages to indirect peers. (DAM is a networking algorithm.)
		        * 
		        * Heroku is used for deployment.
		        *
			*/

			/* --- RUN GUN LOCALLY ---
		        *
		        * Run GUN locally with a npm package. Execute "npm start" in the gun module directory.
		        * 
		        */

			/* --- DATA STORAGE ---
		        *
		        * Some blockchain like enviroments require their peers to store all shared data
		        * but GUN peers can get away with only storing some of the shared data.
		        *
		        * Data for browers is stored in localStorage by default but an indexedDB adapter exists using RAD.
		        *
		        * RAD uses fs to dump to the disk. Other plugins like AWS S3 and more exists as alternatives.
